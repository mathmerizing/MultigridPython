Results on Benchmark Problem
============================

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the following, we are describing the geometric multigrid method,
which for certain problems yields an iterative solver
with optimal time complexity, i.e. the solver returns a solution to a PDE in
:math:`O(n_{\text{DoFs}})` arithmetic operations. We will show that this can also
be achieved for some convection-diffusion equations on uniformly refined triangular
meshes, when discretizing with linear finite elements.



TODO: Probably just make a jupyter notebook
